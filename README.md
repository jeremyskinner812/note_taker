# note_taker

## Description

The motivation for this application was to create a site that could save and show any notes you need for later and can access from anywhere. I built this project to practice working with express and build an express server that connects the front and back end. It solves the problem of needing to save a note for later but not wanting to write it down and not always having access to it. I learned a lot about how to connect the front and back end and building out an express server.
